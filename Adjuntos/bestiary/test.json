The art of the battle mage takes as much practice as any other type of spellcastingâ€”perhaps more so. Many nations count battle mages among their ranks, with most establishing and maintaining an elite college or academy to properly train these living weapons. Just as much time goes into indoctrinating the battle mages into the patriotic beliefs as in the magic itself, for no group wants a powerful weapon turned against its creator."
