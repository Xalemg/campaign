descripcion: "You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#x27;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#x27;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#x27;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#x27;s long range. Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way."
