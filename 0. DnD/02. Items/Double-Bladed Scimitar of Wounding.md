descripcion: "The base item can be found in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, page 21.Hit points lost to this weapon&#x27;s damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature&#x27;s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you&#x27;ve wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success. Special. If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."
