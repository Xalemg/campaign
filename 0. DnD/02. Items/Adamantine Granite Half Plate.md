descripcion: "The base item can be found in Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn, page 228.This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you&#x27;re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer&#x27;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.The stoneguard craft arms and armor from the granite around them, and their magical stonecraft rivals even that of the dwarves.It is likely that this armor functions similarly to the Earthboard with regards to weight.The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks."
