descripcion: "This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can&#x27;t be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#x27;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."
