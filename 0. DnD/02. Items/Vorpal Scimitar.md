descripcion: "You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature&#x27;s heads. The creature dies if it can&#x27;t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn&#x27;t have or need a head, has Legendario actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons."
