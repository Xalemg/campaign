descripcion: "You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&#x27;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&#x27;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&#x27;t attack a target beyond the weapon&#x27;s long range. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property."
