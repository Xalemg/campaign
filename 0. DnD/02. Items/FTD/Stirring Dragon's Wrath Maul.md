descripcion: "This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon&#x27;s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon&#x27;s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon&#x27;s breath weapon.You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon&#x27;s breath weapon. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#x27;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."
