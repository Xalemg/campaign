descripcion: "A dragonlance is a renowned weapon forged from rare metal with the aid of powerful artifacts associated with Bahamut. Different lances are forged for use by foot soldiers (as pikes) and by riders (as lances), but the magical properties of the weapons are the same.You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.When you hit a Dragon with this weapon, the Dragon takes an extra 3d6 force damage, and any Dragon of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you can immediately use its reaction to make a melee attack. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon&#x27;s size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."
