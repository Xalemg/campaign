descripcion: "The base item can be found in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, page 21.You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature&#x27;s heads. The creature dies if it can&#x27;t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn&#x27;t have or need a head, has Legendario actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit. Special. If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."
