descripcion: "This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity&#x27;s alignment. The candle&#x27;s alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.d20Alignment1-2Chaotic evil3-4Chaotic neutral5-7Chaotic good8-9Neutral evil10-11Neutral12-13Neutral good14-15Lawful evil16-17Lawful neutral18-20Lawful goodThe candle&#x27;s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle&#x27;s total burn time.While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle&#x27;s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell&#x27;s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle."
