You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 10d4} acid damage and another {@damage 5d4} acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by {@scaledamage 10d4|4-9|2d4} for each slot level above 4th.
