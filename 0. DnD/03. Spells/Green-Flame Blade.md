# `=this.file.name`
You brandish the weapon used in the spell&#x27;s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack&#x27;s normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra {@damage 1d8} fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to {@damage 1d8} + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by {@damage 1d8} at 11th level ({@damage 2d8} and {@damage 2d8}) and 17th level ({@damage 3d8} and {@damage 3d8}).
