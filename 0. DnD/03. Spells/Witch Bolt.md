# `=this.file.name`
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d12} lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal {@damage 1d12} lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell&#x27;s range or if it has total cover from you.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d12|1-9|1d12} for each slot level above 1st.
