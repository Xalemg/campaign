# `=this.file.name`
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it&#x27;s {@condition invisible}, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can&#x27;t become {@condition invisible} until the spell ends.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|2-9|1d6} for each slot level above 2nd.
