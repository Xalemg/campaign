# `=this.file.name`
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d8 + 1d6} damage. Choose one of the {@dice d8}s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack&#x27;s damage type, as shown below.

[object Object]

If you roll the same number on both {@dice d8}s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.



 


 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes {@scaledamage 2d8 + 1d6|1-9|1d6} extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
