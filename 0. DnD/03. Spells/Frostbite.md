# `=this.file.name`
You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 1d6} cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d6} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d6}), 11th level ({@damage 3d6}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d6}).
