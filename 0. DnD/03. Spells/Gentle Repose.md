# `=this.file.name`
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can&#x27;t become undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don&#x27;t count against the time limit of spells such as {@spell raise dead}.
