# `=this.file.name`
Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes {@damage 8d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn&#x27;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&#x27;t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.



 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d8|4-9|1d8} for each slot level above 4th.
