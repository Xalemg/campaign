# `=this.file.name`
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage and is {@condition restrained} for the spell&#x27;s duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the {@condition restrained} target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the {@condition restrained} target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer {@condition restrained} by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a {@condition restrained} target if you do either.
