# `=this.file.name`
A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can&#x27;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can&#x27;t accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d10} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d10}.



 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d10|3-9|1d10} for each slot level above 3rd.
