# `=this.file.name`
A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, or {@condition stunned}, the condition ends. If the creature is {@condition prone}, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
