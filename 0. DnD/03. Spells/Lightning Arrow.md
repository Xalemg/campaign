# `=this.file.name`
The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell&#x27;s duration, the weapon&#x27;s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it&#x27;s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes {@damage 4d8} lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon&#x27;s normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes {@damage 2d8} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.



 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by {@scaledamage 4d8;2d8|3-9|1d8} for each slot level above 3rd.
