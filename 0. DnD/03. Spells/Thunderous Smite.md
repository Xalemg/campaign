# `=this.file.name`
The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell&#x27;s duration, your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 2d6} thunder damage to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked {@condition prone}.
