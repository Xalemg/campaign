# `=this.file.name`
You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire&#x27;s space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire&#x27;s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren&#x27;t being worn or carried.

The spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8}).
