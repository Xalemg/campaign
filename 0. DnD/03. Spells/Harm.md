# `=this.file.name`
You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 14d6} necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can&#x27;t reduce the target&#x27;s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature&#x27;s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
