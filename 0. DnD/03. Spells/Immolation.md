# `=this.file.name`
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell&#x27;s duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can&#x27;t be extinguished by nonmagical means.

If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.
