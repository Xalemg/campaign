# `=this.file.name`
The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell&#x27;s duration, your attack deals an extra {@damage 1d6} psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
