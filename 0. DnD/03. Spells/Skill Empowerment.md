Your magic deepens a creature&#x27;s understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn&#x27;t already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.
