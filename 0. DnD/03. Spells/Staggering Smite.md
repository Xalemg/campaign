# `=this.file.name`
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell&#x27;s duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 4d6} psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can&#x27;t take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
