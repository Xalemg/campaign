# `=this.file.name`
Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is {@condition poisoned}.

At the end of each of the {@condition poisoned} target&#x27;s turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer {@condition poisoned}, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer {@condition poisoned}, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell&#x27;s duration.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease&#x27;s effects apply to it.
