# `=this.file.name`
You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature&#x27;s injuries. You take {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage, which can&#x27;t be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d8|3-9|1d8} for each slot level above 3rd.
