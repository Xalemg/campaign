# `=this.file.name`
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature&#x27;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a {@creature unicorn}), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a {@spell polymorph} spell, this spell doesn&#x27;t locate the creature.

This spell can&#x27;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.
