# `=this.file.name`
You create a long, vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes {@damage 1d6} piercing damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d6} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d6}), 11th level ({@damage 3d6}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d6}).
