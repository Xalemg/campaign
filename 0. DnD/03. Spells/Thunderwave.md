# `=this.file.name`
A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d8} thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#x27;t pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#x27;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|1-9|1d8} for each slot level above 1st.
