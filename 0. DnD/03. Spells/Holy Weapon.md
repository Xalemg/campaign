# `=this.file.name`
You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra {@damage 2d8} radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn&#x27;t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 4d8} radiant damage, and it is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn&#x27;t {@condition blinded}. At the end of each of its turns, a {@condition blinded} creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
