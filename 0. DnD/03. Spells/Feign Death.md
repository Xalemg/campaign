# `=this.file.name`
You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the spell&#x27;s duration, or until you use an action to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target&#x27;s status. The target is {@condition blinded} and {@condition incapacitated}, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or {@condition poisoned} when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or {@condition poisoned} while under the spell&#x27;s effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.
