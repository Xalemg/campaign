# `=this.file.name`
A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll {@dice 6d10}; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring {@condition unconscious} creatures and creatures that can&#x27;t see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is {@condition blinded} until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature&#x27;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&#x27;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional {@scaledice 6d10|1-9|2d10} for each slot level above 1st.
