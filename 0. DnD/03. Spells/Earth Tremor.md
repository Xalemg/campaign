# `=this.file.name`
You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 1d6} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition prone}. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 1d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.
