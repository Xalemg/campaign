# `=this.file.name`
You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals {@damage 1d4 + 1} force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.
