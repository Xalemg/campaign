# `=this.file.name`
By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes {@condition invisible} and can&#x27;t be targeted by {@filter divination spells|spells|school&#x3D;D} or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn&#x27;t grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include &quot;after 1,000 years&quot; or &quot;when the {@creature tarrasque} awakens.&quot; This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
