# `=this.file.name`
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 2d8} poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also {@condition poisoned} until the end of your next turn.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|1-9|1d8} for each slot level above 1st.
