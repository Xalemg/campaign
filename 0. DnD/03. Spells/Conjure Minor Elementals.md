# `=this.file.name`
You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You choose one the following options for what appears:

[object Object]

An elemental summoned by this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don&#x27;t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The DM has the creatures&#x27; statistics.



 


 


 


 


 


When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.
