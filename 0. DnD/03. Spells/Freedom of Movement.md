# `=this.file.name`
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target&#x27;s movement is unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&#x27;s speed nor cause the target to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it {@condition grappled}. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target&#x27;s movement or attacks.
