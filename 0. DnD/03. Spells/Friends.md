For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn&#x27;t hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM&#x27;s discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
