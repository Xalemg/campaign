# `=this.file.name`
A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 8d6} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&#x27;t being worn or carried.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d6|3-9|1d6} for each slot level above 3rd.
