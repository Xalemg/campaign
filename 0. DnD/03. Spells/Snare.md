# `=this.file.name`
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell&#x27;s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is {@condition restrained} there until the spell ends.

A {@condition restrained} creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the {@condition restrained} effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is {@condition restrained} by it.
