# `=this.file.name`
Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can&#x27;t become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: {@condition blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, {@condition poisoned}, and {@condition stunned}.
