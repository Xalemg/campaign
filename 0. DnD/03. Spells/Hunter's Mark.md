# `=this.file.name`
You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra {@damage 1d6} damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
