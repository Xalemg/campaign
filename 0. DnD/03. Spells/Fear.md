# `=this.file.name`
You project a phantasmal image of a creature&#x27;s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become {@condition frightened} for the duration.

While {@condition frightened} by this spell, a creature must take the {@action Dash} action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn&#x27;t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
