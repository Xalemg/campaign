# `=this.file.name`
A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d10} force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
