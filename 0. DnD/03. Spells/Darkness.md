# `=this.file.name`
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can&#x27;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&#x27;t illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn&#x27;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell&#x27;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
