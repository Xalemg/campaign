# `=this.file.name`
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes {@damage 2d4} piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can&#x27;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
