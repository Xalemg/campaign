# `=this.file.name`
You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take {@damage 1d8} lightning damage if it is within 5 feet of you.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8}).
