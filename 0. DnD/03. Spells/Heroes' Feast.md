# `=this.file.name`
You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial effects don&#x27;t set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve creatures can partake of the feast.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being {@condition frightened}, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by {@dice 2d10}, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.
