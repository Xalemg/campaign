# `=this.file.name`
You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of {@quickref difficult terrain||3} with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes {@damage 6d6} bludgeoning damage and is {@condition restrained}, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The {@condition restrained} creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature&#x27;s choice) against the spell&#x27;s save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer {@condition restrained} and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
