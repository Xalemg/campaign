# `=this.file.name`
A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes {@damage 2d8} necrotic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage, and until the spell ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage to the target. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell&#x27;s range, or if the target has total cover from you.

Whenever the spell deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d8;2d8|5-9|1d8} for each slot level above 5th.
