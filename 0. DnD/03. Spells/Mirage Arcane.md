# `=this.file.name`
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain&#x27;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn&#x27;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell&#x27;s area disappears immediately.

Creatures with {@sense truesight} can see through the illusion to the terrain&#x27;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion&#x27;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.
