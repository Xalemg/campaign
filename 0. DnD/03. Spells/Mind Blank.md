Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the {@condition charmed} condition. The spell even foils {@spell wish} spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target&#x27;s mind or to gain information about the target.
