A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell&#x27;s duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes {@damage 2d4} acid damage at start of each of its turns.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d4|1-9|2d4} for each slot level above 1st.
