# `=this.file.name`
Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes {@damage 2d8} fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn&#x27;t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.
