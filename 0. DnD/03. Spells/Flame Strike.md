# `=this.file.name`
A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage and {@damage 4d6} radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by {@scaledamage 4d6|5-9|1d6} for each slot level above 5th.
