# `=this.file.name`
You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 2d10} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d10|1-9|1d10} for each slot level above 1st.
