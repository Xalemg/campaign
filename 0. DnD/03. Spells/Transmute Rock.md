# `=this.file.name`
You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.

[object Object]

The ground in the spell&#x27;s area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is {@condition restrained}, though it can use an action to end the {@condition restrained} condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.

If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Transmute Rock to Mud
Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell&#x27;s duration. 


 


 

Transmute Mud to Rock
Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell&#x27;s duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition restrained} by the rock. A {@condition restrained} creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.
