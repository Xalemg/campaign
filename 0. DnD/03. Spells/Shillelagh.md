# `=this.file.name`
The wood of a {@item club|phb} or {@item quarterstaff|phb} you are holding is imbued with nature&#x27;s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon&#x27;s damage die becomes a {@dice d8}. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn&#x27;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
