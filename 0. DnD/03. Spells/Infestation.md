# `=this.file.name`
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes {@damage 1d6} poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a {@dice d4} for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn&#x27;t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn&#x27;t move.

The spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d6} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d6}), 11th level ({@damage 3d6}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d6}).
