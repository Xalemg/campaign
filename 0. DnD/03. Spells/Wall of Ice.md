# `=this.file.name`
You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature&#x27;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 10d6} cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes {@damage 5d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by {@scaledamage 10d6|6-9|2d6}, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by {@scaledamage 5d6|6-9|1d6}, for each slot level above 6th.
