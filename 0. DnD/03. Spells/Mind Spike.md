# `=this.file.name`
You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking {@damage 3d8} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, you also always know the target&#x27;s location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can&#x27;t become hidden from you, and if it&#x27;s {@condition invisible}, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.
