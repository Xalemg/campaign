# `=this.file.name`
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&#x27;t being worn or carried.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d6|3-9|1d6} for each slot level above 3rd.
