# `=this.file.name`
You fill the air with spinning daggers in a cube 5 feet on each side, centered on a point you choose within range. A creature takes {@damage 4d4} slashing damage when it enters the spell&#x27;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 4d4|2-9|2d4} for each slot level above 2nd.
