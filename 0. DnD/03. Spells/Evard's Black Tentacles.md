# `=this.file.name`
Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage and be {@condition restrained} by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already {@condition restrained} by the tentacles takes {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage.

A creature {@condition restrained} by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
