# `=this.file.name`
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks and can&#x27;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
