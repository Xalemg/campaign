# `=this.file.name`
You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren&#x27;t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive &quot;unclear&quot; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity&#x27;s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity&#x27;s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative {@chance 25|||No answer!|Answer} chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.
