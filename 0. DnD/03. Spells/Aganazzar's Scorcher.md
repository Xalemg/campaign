# `=this.file.name`
A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|2-9|1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.
