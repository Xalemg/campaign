# `=this.file.name`
You brandish the weapon used in the spell&#x27;s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack&#x27;s normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes {@damage 1d8} thunder damage, and the spell ends.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra {@damage 1d8} thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to {@damage 2d8}. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level ({@damage 2d8} and {@damage 3d8}) and again at 17th level ({@damage 3d8} and {@damage 4d8}).
