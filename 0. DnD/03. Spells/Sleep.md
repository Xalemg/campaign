# `=this.file.name`
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll {@dice 5d8}; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring {@condition unconscious} creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls {@condition unconscious} until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature&#x27;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&#x27;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being {@condition charmed} aren&#x27;t affected by this spell.
