# `=this.file.name`
You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take {@damage 6d6} psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can&#x27;t take actions, can&#x27;t understand what other creatures say, can&#x27;t read, and speak only in gibberish. A {@spell greater restoration} spell cast on you ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;maybe,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; &quot;irrelevant,&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; (if the entity doesn&#x27;t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
