# `=this.file.name`
You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take {@damage 1d6} psychic damage and subtract {@dice 1d4} from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d6} when you reach certain levels: 5th level ({@dice 2d6}), 11th level ({@dice 3d6}), and 17th level ({@dice 4d6}).
