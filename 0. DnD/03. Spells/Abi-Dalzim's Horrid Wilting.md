# `=this.file.name`
You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren&#x27;t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes {@damage 12d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Nonmagical plants in the area that aren&#x27;t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
