# `=this.file.name`
A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 2d8} bludgeoning damage and {@damage 4d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm&#x27;s area of effect into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until the end of your next turn.



 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|4-9|1d8} for each slot level above 4th.
