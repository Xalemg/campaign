# `=this.file.name`
You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.

Grasses and Undergrowth
Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for your enemies. 

Trees
At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 4d6} slashing damage from whipping branches. 

Roots and Vines
At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become {@condition restrained} until the spell ends. A {@condition restrained} creature can use an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

Rocks
As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d8} nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.
