# `=this.file.name`
You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target&#x27;s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&#x27;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&#x27;s abilities or magic items, it can&#x27;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a {@dice d20}. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn&#x27;t take effect until the creature&#x27;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can&#x27;t, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
