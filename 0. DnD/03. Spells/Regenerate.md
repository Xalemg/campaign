# `=this.file.name`
You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains {@dice 4d8 + 15} hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

The target&#x27;s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
