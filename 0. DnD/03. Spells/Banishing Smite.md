# `=this.file.name`
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon crackles with force, and the attack deals an extra {@damage 5d10} force damage to the target. Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you&#x27;re on, the target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to the plane you&#x27;re on, the creature vanishes into a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is {@condition incapacitated}. It remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
