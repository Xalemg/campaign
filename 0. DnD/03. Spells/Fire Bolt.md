# `=this.file.name`
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d10} fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn&#x27;t being worn or carried.

This spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d10} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d10}), 11th level ({@damage 3d10}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d10}).
