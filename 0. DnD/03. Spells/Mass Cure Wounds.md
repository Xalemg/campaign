# `=this.file.name`
A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to {@dice 3d8} + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by {@scaledice 3d8|5-9|1d8} for each slot level above 5th.
