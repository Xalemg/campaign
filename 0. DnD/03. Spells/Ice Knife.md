# `=this.file.name`
You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d10} piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 2d6} cold damage.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.
