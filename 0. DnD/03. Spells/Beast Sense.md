# `=this.file.name`
You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to see through the beast&#x27;s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the beast&#x27;s senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} to your own surroundings.
