# `=this.file.name`
This spell assaults and twists creatures&#x27; minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can&#x27;t take reactions and must roll a {@dice d10} at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

[object Object]

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.



 


 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
