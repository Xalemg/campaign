# `=this.file.name`
A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn&#x27;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this spell&#x27;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
