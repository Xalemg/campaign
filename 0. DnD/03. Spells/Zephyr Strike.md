You move like the wind. Until the spell ends, your movement doesn&#x27;t provoke opportunity attacks.

Once before the spell ends, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That attack deals an extra {@damage 1d8} force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or miss, your walking speed increases by 30 feet until the end of that turn.
