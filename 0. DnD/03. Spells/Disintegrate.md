# `=this.file.name`
A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by {@spell wall of force}.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes {@damage 10d6 + 40} force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a {@spell true resurrection} or a {@spell wish} spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.



 


 


 


 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 10d6 + 40|6-9|3d6} for each slot level above 6th.
