You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn&#x27;t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn&#x27;t have to move away. A {@condition deafened} creature automatically succeeds on the save.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.
