# `=this.file.name`
A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell&#x27;s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage. The sphere&#x27;s space is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d6} lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to listen.
