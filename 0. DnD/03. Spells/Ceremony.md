Atonement
You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment. 

Bless Water
You touch one {@item vial|phb} of water and cause it to become {@item Holy Water (flask)|phb|holy water}. 

Coming of Age
You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once. 

Dedication
You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god&#x27;s service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once. 

Funeral Rite
You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can&#x27;t become undead by any means short of a {@spell wish} spell. 

Wedding
You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.
