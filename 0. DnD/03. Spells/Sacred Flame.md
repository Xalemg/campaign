# `=this.file.name`
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8}).
