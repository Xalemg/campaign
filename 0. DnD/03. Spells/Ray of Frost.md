# `=this.file.name`
A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes {@damage 1d8} cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell&#x27;s damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage 4d8}).
