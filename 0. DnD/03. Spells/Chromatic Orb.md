# `=this.file.name`
You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes {@damage 3d8} damage of the type you chose.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d8|1-9|1d8} for each slot level above 1st.
