# `=this.file.name`
You utter foul words, summoning demons from the chaos of the Abyss. Roll on the following table to determine what appears.

[object Object]

The DM chooses the demons, such as {@creature manes} or {@creature dretch||dretches}, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can&#x27;t cross the circle or harm it, and they can&#x27;t target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.
