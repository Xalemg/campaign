# `=this.file.name`
You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

[object Object]

Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don&#x27;t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The DM has the creatures&#x27; statistics.
