You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
