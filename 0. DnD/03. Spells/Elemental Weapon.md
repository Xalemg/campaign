A nonmagical weapon you touch becomes a magic weapon. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. For the duration, the weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls and deals an extra {@damage 1d4} damage of the chosen type when it hits.



 


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, the bonus to attack rolls increases to +2 and the extra damage increases to {@scaledamage 1d4|3-9|2d4}. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3 and the extra damage increases to {@scaledamage 1d4|3-9|3d4}.
